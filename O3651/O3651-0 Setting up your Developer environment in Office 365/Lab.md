####Option 1 - Create a new free trial (easy way)
3. Sign up for an Azure trial subscription
  1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)
  2. When prompted, log in using the credentials you created for your O365 subscription.(admin@[tenant].onmicrosoft.com)

  5. Fill out the form to obtain your free trial. We'll be using it throughout the day. 
  NOTE: YES, you need to enter your credit card info, this is how we prove you're an adult and not gaming the system. NO, we won't bill you unless you explicitly let us. You will get repeated emails asking if you want to start paying, and unless you respond to an email and agree to start paying, you won't get charged.

01. Sign into the [Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) with your current azure account.

02. Click **+ New**

05. You will be signed out of the portal and redirected to a sign-in page. Sign in using the credentials for a global
    administrator in your O365 tenant.

    ![](img/00015_sign_in_as_directory_global_admin.png)

06. When authenticated click **continue**. This will add your Azure account as a global administrator of the O365
    directory.
